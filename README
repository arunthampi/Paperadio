Paperadio - Listen to your Instapaper
=====================================

This is a MacRuby application which reads your Instapaper-saved articles to you on Mac OS X.

This is an alpha, proof-of-concept application and as such, no guarantees to its proper functioning are provided.

Any feedback or pull requests are more than welcome, though!

To build
--------

1. You need XCode and MacRuby 0.8.
2. Once you open the XCode project, click Build+Run.
3. Open up Terminal, go to your Build folder (and then Debug or Release, depending on your active configuration), and run macruby_deploy --embed Paperadio.app
4. You now have a standalone Cocoa app which you can then copy to your /Applications folder to use (hopefully on a daily basis!)

TODO
----

1. Optimizations
2. Better Error Handling
3. Great Icon!
